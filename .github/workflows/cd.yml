    # Only run if CI passes. We need to duplicate the triggers or make this depend on a workflow_run.
    # Simpler approach: define CI steps here or rely on the fact that if CI fails, we usually don't want to deploy?
    # Better: This workflow trigger runs in parallel. Let's make it independent but robust.
    # Note: 'needs' only works for jobs within the same workflow.
    # We will assume CI runs in parallel or we can merge them.
    # For separation of concerns, keeping separate. If CI fails, the commit is bad anyway.
